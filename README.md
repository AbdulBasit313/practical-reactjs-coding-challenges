# Free ReactJS Coding Challenges: Build Functionality for Responsive UI

**Tech Stack:** ReactJS with Typescript

## Who Can Use these ReactJS Coding Challenges?

1. Beginner developers looking for a fun little **frontend coding challenges** to test their **ReactJS logic-building** skills

2. Developers interested in building small tools that they can convert into **micro SAAS**

3. Companies looking for **ReactJS hiring challenges** to assess their candidate's ReactJS coding skills

## List of Reactjs Challenges

All challenges are free. I wanted the challenges to be different and designed them carefully. In each challenge, I have covered different skill sets of JavaScript and Reactjs, from the array to object, the string to regex, and Reactjs hooks.

## Challenge #1: Introduction to Text Analyzer Tool

The text analyzer is the first in the series of ReactJS coding challenges. In this challenge, we have created a text area that calculates some parameters in the typed or pasted Text. The text area should calculate and show the following:

1. Words
2. Characters
3. Sentences
4. Paragraphs
5. Average reading time
6. The longest word in paragraphs
7. Number of pronouns in the Text (list is given)

## What if you couldnâ€™t do ReactJS Challenges?

Ideally, you should finish these challenges on your own regardless of how long it takes, as figuring it out on your own would help hone your skills as a front-end and ReactJS developer. However, you can see hints if you are stuck somewhere in the middle. Hints will give you a better idea about how to write logic.
